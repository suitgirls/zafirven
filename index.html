       <p>My name is Zahara Firven. I'm a rising junior and I live in Zachary, Louisiana. (East of Baton Rouge). I decided to take this class because my mom is in IT (she works at oracle) and I wanted to get a feel of what she does, and to see if it was something I wanted to pursue in the future. I wanted to do Biomedical engineering or biotechnology so I can work in a hospital still, just in a lab. But I'm also interested in going into the medical field to become a pediatric oncologist to do research and like clinical trials. So, I feel like having a background in biotech will help me with that if I do that first!

<p>Outside of school I love playing sports. I'm on varsity cheerleading and track & field. I also did gymnastics for 9 years.</p>

<p>I love to watch tv shows (only 2 seasons I can't do more). But my favorite shows/ movies are brother bear, miracles from heaven, little women, la la land, and the edge of seventeen.</p>

<p>I have an identical twin sister and an older sister. My dad is a history professor for African American studies, so I've always gotten lectured on that, so I know a good bit about that as well.</p>

<p>I also love hanging out with friends and going out to eat! Like waffle house or maybe Jubans I dont know, but thats it!!</p>
